               <xsd:documentation>The path of and properties along a wellbore defined as a list of traversed grid cells. The direction of the traversal is from a cell that is
               nearer the surface (smaller measured depth) toward a cell that is nearer the bottomhole (larger measured depth). One block wellbore can represent some portion of
               the original hole (i.e., has no kickoff point). For sidetracks (laterals) the blocked wellbore will represent only the new hole from the kickoff point (in another
               blocked wellbore) toward the bottomhole. While the paths represented by the blocked wellbores should not overlap, the paths may intersect some of the same
               cells.</xsd:documentation>
