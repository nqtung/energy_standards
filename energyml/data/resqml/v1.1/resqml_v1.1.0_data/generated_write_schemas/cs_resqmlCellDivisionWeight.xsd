         <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>A list that defines the number of refined cells within each target cell. The length of the list must be equal to the number of target cells in the
            specified direction (i.e., maxIndex-minIndex+1). The target cells are defined by a target cell window (i.e., by a minimum index and maximum index) in the parent grid.
            The order in the aggregate is significant. The first value represents the number of refined cells in the first target cell. The next value represents the number of
            refined cells in the second target cell. The number of resulting cells in specified direction is equal to the sum of this list of counts.</xsd:documentation>

      <xsd:attribute name="weight" type="resqml:listOfFloat" use="required">
         <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>A list that defines the weight to apply to each refined cell within each target cell. The length of the array must be equal to the sum of the counts
            in the count list. The order in the aggregate is significant. The first count(1) values represent the list of refinements for the the first target cell. The next
            count(2) values represent the list of refinements for the second target cell. The first weight within each refinement list applies to the lower index side of the
            target cell. The width of each refined cell will be proportional to the weights within each refinement list. Readers are advised to normalize the weights within each
            refinement list.</xsd:documentation>
