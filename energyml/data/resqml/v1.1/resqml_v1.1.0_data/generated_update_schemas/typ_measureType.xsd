      <xsd:documentation>These types represent numeric quantities with a unit of measure implemented as a uom attribute. The units are gathered into single quantity class which
      represents a group of units. The unit symbols appropriate for the class are captured as enumerated lists. The implementation of this is to develop a type for each uom class
      that is a union of a standard list, the unknown value, and the Other: extension. Additional files will contain these structures.</xsd:documentation>
