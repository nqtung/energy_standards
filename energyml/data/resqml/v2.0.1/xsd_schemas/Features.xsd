		<xs:documentation>Features refer to something that has physical existence at some point during the exploration, development, production, or abandonment of a reservoir. For example: It can be a boundary, a rock volume, a basin area, but also extends to a drilled well, a drilling rig, an injected or produced fluid, or a 2D, 3D, or 4D seismic survey.
In RESQML, features are divided into these categories: geologic or technical. 
Geologic Feature. Objects that exist a priori, in the natural world, for example: the rock formations and how they are positioned with regard to each other; the fluids that are present before production; or the position of the geological intervals with respect to each. Some of these objects are static—such as geologic intervals---while others are dynamic—such as fluids: their properties, geometries, and quantities may change over time during the course of field production.
Technical Feature. Objects that exist by the action of humans. Examples include: wells and all they may contain, seismic surveys (surface, permanent water bottom), or injected fluid volumes. Because the decision to deploy such equipment is the result of studies or decisions by humans, technical features are usually not subject to the same kind of large changes in interpretation as geologic features. However, they are still subject to measurement error and other sources of uncertainty, and so still can be considered as subject to “interpretation”.</xs:documentation>
